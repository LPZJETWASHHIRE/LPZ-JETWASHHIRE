      <h2>Hire Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I the hirer (name) agree to the terms and conditions of this contract of Hire with LPZ-JetWashHire. I the hirer accept full responsibility for the safe keeping and fair use of the jetwash during my term of hire delivery to collection. I accept liability and responsibility for any damage to the jetwash, parts and accessories during my hire term. I accept liability and responsibility for any damage caused to any other item whilst the jetwash is in my use or hire term and understand LPZ-JetWashHire cannot be legally or financially held accountable.
        I am responsible for the Jetwash in its entirety in my hire term and this includes my decision to allow a 3rd person to use it during my hire term. This includes damage the 3rd person causes to the hire jetwash itself, attachments or other item or property or vehicle.
        I am not entitled to further hire or subcontract the jetwash to any other party.
        I understand that if any part of the hose is damaged I will pay the cost to replace this of £80 immediately and in full to the hire company LPZ-JetWashHire.
        I understand that if any attachments that are supplied to me are lost, stolen or damaged I will pay the sum of £15 immediately and in full per item to LPZ-JetWashHire.
        I accept responsibility to keep the jetwash stored in a safe location to prevent theft and if the jetwash is stolen or lost during my term of my contract, I am liable for the full cost of the jetwash and predicted financial loss to the business whilst a replacement is sourced. In this instance I will pay the sum of £1,000 immediately and in full to LPZ-JetWashHire.
        Should I agree to this contract and fail to abide by it, I understand LPZ-JetWashHire have the right to instruct legal advice and proceed to a court hearing to recover finances. I accept the full cost of any legal or court fees LPZ-JetWashHire are invoiced to resolve this matter.
        LPZ-JetWashHire maintain the right to cancel a booking at any time if there is reason to suppose a person or business is acting in a dishonest manner, operating with the intention of theft or any other illegal activity, does not intend to pay for the service or it is believed there is insufficient responsibility of the potential hirer to abide by the terms and conditions of this hire contract.
        LPZ-JetWashHire can cancel a booking at any stage if they are made aware of a breach of contract without providing a refund or reason to the hirer.
