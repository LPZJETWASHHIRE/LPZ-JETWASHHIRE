HIRE CONTRACT

I the hirer (name) agree to the terms and conditions of this contract of Hire with LPZ-JetWashHire. I the hirer accept full responsibility for the safe keeping and fair use of the jetwash during my term of hire delivery to collection.

I accept liability and responsibility for any damage to the jetwash, parts and accessories during my hire term. I accept liability and responsibility for any damage caused to any other item whilst the jetwash is in my use or hire term and understand LPZ-JetWashHire cannot be legally or financially held accountable.

I am responsible for the Jetwash in its entirety during my hire term and this includes my decision to allow a 3rd person to use it. This includes damage the 3rd person causes to the hire jetwash itself, attachments or other items, property or vehicles. I am not entitled to further hire or subcontract the jetwash to any other party.

I understand that if any part of the hose is damaged I will pay the cost to replace this of £80 immediately and in full to the hire company LPZ-JetWashHire.

I understand that if any attachments that are supplied to me are lost, stolen or damaged I will pay the sum of £15 immediately and in full per item to LPZ-JetWashHire.

I accept responsibility to keep the jetwash stored in a safe location to prevent theft and if the jetwash is stolen or lost during my hire term, I am liable for the full cost of the jetwash and predicted financial loss to the business whilst a replacement is sourced. In this instance I will pay the sum of £1,000 immediately and in full to LPZ-JetWashHire.

Should I agree to this contract and fail to abide by it, I understand LPZ-JetWashHire have the right to instruct legal advice and proceed to a court hearing to recover finances. I accept the full cost of any legal or court fees LPZ-JetWashHire are invoiced to resolve this matter.

LPZ-JetWashHire maintain the right to cancel a booking at any time if there is reason to suppose a person or business is acting dishonestly, intends to steal, or participate in illegal activity, or does not show sufficient responsibility to abide by this contract. LPZ-JetWashHire can cancel a booking at any stage if they are made aware of a breach of contract, without providing a refund or reason to the hirer.

At the time of delivery I have inspected the JetWash with the hire company representative and note the following damage prior to my use:
